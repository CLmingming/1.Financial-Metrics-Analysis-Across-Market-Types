This study involves analyzing financial and market data for A-share listed firms in China to evaluate key performance indicators and compare trends across market types. Utilizing the CSMAR database, the research compiles three categories of data:

Monthly market data (January 2000–September 2023), including stock prices, returns, and tradable market capitalization.
Quarterly financial statements (2000Q1–2023Q3), comprising total assets, total liabilities, earnings per share (EPS), ROA, ROE, and R&D expenses.
Firm-specific information, such as establishment dates and market type classifications (e.g., Main Board vs. GEM Board).
The analysis proceeds in two stages:
(a) Ratio Derivation: Manual computation of financial metrics, including monthly price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios derived from stock prices, EPS, and book value per share (total assets minus liabilities). Quarterly metrics include R&D intensity (R&D expenses relative to total assets) and firm age (time since establishment).

(b) Comparative Summary Statistics: Statistical evaluation of monthly returns, P/E, P/B, quarterly ROA, ROE, R&D intensity, and firm age, segmented by market type. Metrics such as mean, median, quartiles (p25, p75), standard deviation, and observation counts are calculated to contrast performance and risk profiles between Main Board and GEM Board firms. The findings aim to uncover structural differences in valuation, profitability, innovation investment, and maturity across these markets, providing insights into their distinct characteristics and investor implications.
